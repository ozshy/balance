The R-code xxx draws Figure 6 in the paper. 

All algebraci derivations for the above article can be found on balance_2023_mm_dd.pdf (which the reader can download). The reader can then scroll down to the desired derivation using the same section, subsection, and equation numbers correspoding to the paper itself.

The above PDF file was constructed from a symbolic algebra software called "Derive for Windows." The file balance_2023_mm_dd.dfw requires this sofware, so it is sufficient for the reader to download only on the above PDF.
