Numerical simulations (R-code) for Figure 6 in a paper entitled: 

"Why Do Banks Require Minimum Balance to Avoid a Fee?" by Oz Shy 

The R-code "balance_2023_12_10.R" draws Figure 6 in the paper. 

All algebraic derivations for the above article can be found on "balance_2023_12_22.pdf" (which the reader can download). The reader can then scroll down to the desired derivation using the same section, subsection, and equation numbers correspoding to the paper itself.

The above PDF file was constructed using a symbolic algebra software called "Derive for Windows." The file "balance_2023_12_22.dfw" requires this sofware (which most people don't have). Therefore, it is sufficient for the reader to download only on the above PDF.
